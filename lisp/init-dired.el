;; This configuration customizes `dired' to enhance its usability. The settings
;; below specify how file listings are displayed, the target for file operations,
;; and associations for opening various file types with their respective applications.
;; For example, image files will open with `feh', while audio and video files
;; will utilize `mpv'.
